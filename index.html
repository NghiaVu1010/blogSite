                  <h4>What is a taco?</h4>
                  
                  <p>A taco is a traditional Mexican dish consisting of a corn or wheat tortilla   
                    folded or rolled around a filling. A taco can be made with a variety of 
                    fillings, including beef, pork, chicken, seafood, vegetables, and cheese, 
                    allowing great versatility and variety. Tacos are generally eaten without 
                    utensils, often garnished with salsa, chili pepper, avocado, guacamole, 
                    cilantro (coriander), tomatoes, onions, and lettuce.</p>
              
                  <p>The origins of the taco are not precisely known, and etymologies for the 
                    culinary usage of the word are generally theoretical. According to the 
                    Real Academia Española, publisher of Diccionario de la Lengua Española, the 
                    word taco describes a typical Mexican dish of a maize tortilla folded 
                    around food. This meaning of the Spanish word "taco" is a Mexican 
                    innovation, but in other dialects "taco" is used to mean "wedge; wad, plug; 
                    billiard cue; blowpipe; ramrod; short, stocky person; [or] short, thick 
                    piece of wood." In this non-culinary usage, the word "taco" has cognates in 
                    other European languages, including the French word "tache" and the English 
                    word "tack (nail)." According to one etymological theory, the culinary 
                    meaning of "taco" derives from its "plug" meaning as employed among 
                    Mexican silver miners, who used explosive charges in plug form consisting 
                    of a paper wrapper and gunpowder filling.
                    Indigenous origins for the culinary word "taco" are also proposed. One 
                    possibility is that the word derives from the Nahuatl word "tlahco", 
                    meaning "half" or "in the middle," in the sense that food would be placed 
                    in the middle of a tortilla. Furthermore, dishes analogous to the taco 
                    were known to have existed in Pre-Columbian society—for example, the 
                    Náhuatl word "tlaxcalli" (a type of corn tortilla).</p>
